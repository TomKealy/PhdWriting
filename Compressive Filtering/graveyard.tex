However, signal reconstruction is not the only interesting signal processing task. Filtering, classification, detection, and estimation are also required in real world systems. For these tasks it was thought that signal reconstruction must be performed first, and then classical signal processing techniques could be brought to bear on the reconstruction. 

There is some tension in this idea however: since the measurement matrix is an approximate isometry, some (as yet unspecified) operations on the measurements \(y\) should correspond to inference tasks (such as filtering and estimation) on \(x\). This means that performing inference neednâ€™t require the reconstruction of the signal.
