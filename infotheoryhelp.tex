This is a short document outlining some things you need to be able to do to understnad information theory.

\begin{enumerate}
\item Be able to recall Jensen's Inequality and the Log-Sum and Generalised Log-Sum inequalities.
\item Apply the above inequalities to prove facts about Entropy, Relative Entropy, Mutual Information, and other quantities used in Information Theory.
\item Be able to construct Shannon Codes and Huffman Codes.
\item Be able to show that Shannon codes are sandwiched between the Entropy and Entropy+1 in expected length.
\item Be able to state the AEP.
\item Show how the AEP implies both of Shannon's other Theorems.
\item Be able to calculate the Capacity of the Binary Symmetric and Binary Erasure Channels.
\end{enumerate}
