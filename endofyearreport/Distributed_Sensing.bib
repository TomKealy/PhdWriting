abstract = {In emerging cognitive radio (CR) networks with spectrum sharing, the first cognitive task preceding any dynamic spectrum access is the sensing and identification of spectral holes in wireless environments. This paper develops a distributed compressed spectrum sensing approach for (ultra-)wideband CR networks. Compressed sensing is performed at local CRs to scan the very wide spectrum at practical signal-acquisition complexity. Meanwhile, spectral estimates from multiple local CR detectors are fused to collect spatial diversity gain, which improves the sensing quality especially under fading channels. New distributed consensus algorithms are developed for collaborative sensing and fusion. Using only one-hop local communications, these distributed algorithms converge fast to the globally optimal solutions even for multi-hop CR networks, at low communication and computation load scalable to the network size.},

abstract = {The spectrum sensing problem has gained new aspects with cognitive radio and opportunistic spectrum access concepts. It is one of the most challenging issues in cognitive radio systems. In this paper, a survey of spectrum sensing methodologies for cognitive radio is presented. Various aspects of spectrum sensing problem are studied from a cognitive radio perspective and multi-dimensional spectrum sensing concept is introduced. Challenges associated with spectrum sensing are given and enabling spectrum sensing methods are reviewed. The paper explains the cooperative sensing concept and its various forms. External sensing algorithms and other alternative sensing methods are discussed. Furthermore, statistical modeling of network traffic and utilization of these models for prediction of primary user behavior is studied. Finally, sensing features of some current wireless standards are given.},

abstract = {Wideband spectrum sensing in heterogenous cognitive radio networks has two significant challenges to tackle. One is the spectrum acquisition in the wideband scenario due to the limited sampling capability; the other is how to collaborate among the secondary users. Compressed spectrum sensing provides a powerful approach to acquire wideband signal. Moreover, most cooperative spectrum sensing methods assume that all the secondary users experience the same occupancy of primary users, which may be infeasible in a heterogenous spectrum environment where secondary users at different locations may be affected by different primary users. In this paper, we propose a probabilistic graphical model to represent and fuse multi-prior information from one hop neighboring secondary users. Belief propagation (BP) is used for the statistical inference of the spectrum occupancy. Numerical simulation results demonstrate that the proposed BP based cooperative compressed spectrum sensing can effectively achieve cooperation in heterogenous environments and improve performance of compressed spectrum sensing under a low sampling rate and low signal-to-noise ratio (SNR), compared with the other distributed cooperative compressed sensing methods.},

@article{Baron2005,
abstract = {Compressed sensing is an emerging field based on the revelation that a small collection of linear projections of a sparse signal contains enough information for reconstruction. In this paper we introduce a new theory for distributed compressed sensing (DCS) that enables new distributed coding algorithms for multi-signal ensembles that exploit both intra- and inter-signal correlation structures. The DCS theory rests on a new concept that we term the joint sparsity of a signal ensemble. We study in detail three simple models for jointly sparse signals, propose algorithms for joint recovery of multiple signals from incoherent projections, and characterize theoretically and empirically the number of measurements per sensor required for accurate reconstruction. We establish a parallel with the Slepian-Wolf theorem from information theory and establish upper and lower bounds on the measurement rates required for encoding jointly sparse signals. In two of our three models, the results are asymptotically best-possible, meaning that both the upper and lower bounds match the performance of our practical algorithms. Moreover, simulations indicate that the asymptotics take effect with just a moderate number of signals. In some sense DCS is a framework for distributed compression of sources with memory, which has remained a challenging problem for some time. DCS is immediately applicable to a range of problems in sensor networks and arrays.},

abstract = {In cognitive radio networks, the first cognitive task preceding any form of dynamic spectrum management is the sensing and identification of spectrum holes in wireless environments. This paper develops a wavelet approach to efficient spectrum sensing of wideband channels. The signal spectrum over a wide frequency band is decomposed into elementary building blocks of subbands that are well characterized by local irregularities in frequency. As a powerful mathematical tool for analyzing singularities and edges, the wavelet transform is employed to detect and estimate the local spectral irregular structure, which carries important information on the frequency locations and power spectral densities of the subbands. Along this line, a couple of wideband spectrum sensing techniques are developed based on the local maxima of the wavelet transform modulus and the multi-scale wavelet products. The proposed sensing techniques provide an effective radio sensing architecture to identify and locate spectrum holes in the signal spectrum},

abstract = {A novel distributed compressed wideband sensing scheme for Cognitive Radio Sensor Networks (CRSN) is proposed in this paper. Taking advantage of the distributive nature of CRSN, the proposed scheme deploys only one single narrowband sampler with ultra-low sampling rate at each nodes to accomplish the wideband spectrum sensing. First, the practical structure of the compressed sampler at each node is described in detail. Second, we show how the Fusion Center (FC) exploits the sampled signals with their spectrum randomly-aliased to detect the global wideband spectrum activity. Finally, the proposed scheme is validated through extensive simulations, which shows that it is particularly suitable for CRSN.},
