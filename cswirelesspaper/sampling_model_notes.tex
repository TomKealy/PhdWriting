Since \(p_i\) is periodic it has Fourier expansion:

\begin{equation}
p_j\left(t\right) = \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{jl} \exp\left({jlt\frac{2\pi}{T_p}}\right)
\end{equation}

The \(c_{jl}\) are the Fourier coefficients of the expansion and are defined as:

\begin{equation}
c_{jl} = \frac{1}{T_p} \int p_j\left(t\right)\exp{\left(-ilt\frac{2\pi}{T_p}\right)} dt
\end{equation}

, with Fourier transform:

\begin{align}
g_{j}\left(f\right) &= \int_{-\infty}^{\infty} G\left(t\right) \left( \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{jl} \exp\left({jlt\frac{2\pi}{T_p}} \right)\right) \exp{\left(-i2\pi x t\right)} dt \nonumber \\ 
&= \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{jl} \int G \left(t\right) \exp{\left(-i 2\pi \left( f-1/T_p \right) \right) } dt \\
&= \sum_{l=-\infty}^{\infty} c_{il} g\left(f-lf_p\right)
\end{align}

The output of this mixing process then, is a linear combination of shifted copies of \(g\left(f\right)\), with at most \(\lceil f_{NYQ}/f_p\rceil\) terms since \(g\left(f\right)\) is zero outside its support (we have assumed this Nyquist frequency exists, even though we never sample at that rate).

This process is repeated in parallel at each node so that each band in \(g\) appears in baseband.

Once the mixing process has been completed the signal at each node is low-pass filtered and sampled at a rate \(f_s \geq f_p\).
